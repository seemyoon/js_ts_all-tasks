------task 1------
You need to iterate over this array:
If the number is less than 0 — skip it.
If the number is greater than 100 — stop the loop.
In all other cases — output the number to the console.
const numbers = [10, -5, 20, -3, 0, 55, 130, 60];


------task 2------
You need to:
Skip the purchase if the product is out of stock (inStock === false) - use continue.
Stop the iteration if the product price is greater than 1000 — use break.
Otherwise, output the product name and price to the console.
const purchases = [
{ name: 'Laptop', price: 900, inStock: true },
{ name: 'Mouse', price: 25, inStock: false },
{ name: 'Keyboard', price: 45, inStock: true },
{ name: 'Monitor', price: 1200, inStock: true },
{ name: 'USB Cable', price: 10, inStock: true },
];
